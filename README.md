## Development Programs
Development programs are states of focus for projects like Simpl-Py. You can take a topic or feature that
needs improvement in a project and turn it into a dev program so developers have a focus and a goal.

Here is a list of  Dev Programs for Simpl-Py:
### Simpl-Py EXtended (2022) `OPEN`
<img src="https://github.com/Zer0-Official/Simpl-Py/blob/main/media/SPY%20EX%20banner.png" align="right"/>
Simpl-Py EXtended (SPY-EX) is the first Dev Program for Simpl-Py. This program focuses on making the
language open to customization and adjustments for the user. This program may run for about 2 months.

Here are some examples of what may take place in the program:
* A new interpreter console for the language with enhancing and adjustment options
* A module system for users to add their own piece of code into the pie
* New advertising and communication guidelines for the user
* More interaction with the user within the language
* --items may be removed or added--

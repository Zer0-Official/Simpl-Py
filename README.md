# Code
The syntax in Simpl-Py is easy to learn and understand. Here is the hello world program in Simpl-Py:
```
>> print
Print What? >> Hello World
Hello World
```
*(">>" shows user input)*

## Features
* Full interpreter
* Support on Python 3.6+
* Documentation
* Over 25 errors with codes for assistance

# Download and Run
*There are 2 ways to download Simpl-Py*

#### Method 1
Click the 'Download Code' button above. Unzip the file and execute the `Simpl.py` file (or the `Simpl-Py.exe` if provided).

#### Method 2
`git clone https://github.com/zer0-official/simpl-py`
<br>
*The requirements are found in `requirements.txt`*

# More Code
*Here are some examples made in Simpl-Py:*

*(">>" shows user input)*

#### print.echo example:
print.echo will print any text on the screen as many times as you want (almost)
```
>> print.echo
Echo What?  >> simpl-py (text to echo)
Echo Space?  >> 3 (number of spaces between strings)
Echo Amount? >> 5 (times to echo)
```
Output:
```
simpl-py   simpl-py   simpl-py   simpl-py   simpl-py
```

#### print_math example:
print_math will do basic math operations with a (kind of) infinite amount of integers
```
>> print_math
Integer Amount?  >> 3 (amount of numbers to operate)
Integer:  >> 4
Integer:  >> 7
Integer:  >> 2
Operator (+, -, *, /):  >> +
```
Output:
```
13
```

#### Module example:
Included in Simpl-Py 0.8.0-beta, is a fun feature that gives you the ability to import modules. Simpl-Py comes with a
test module just for you to import, so **follow along with your program!** As expected, importing is easy:
```
>> @module                          (the name after "@" will be imported)
This is a Simpl-Py Example Module   (welcome text displayed after first import)
What Function?  >> inside           (call function inside module)
This is inside the function.        (output from module)
```
Great! We just imported a module and accessed a function inside. Try calling `inside` from @module again to see that the welcome text is not displayed twice.

*Read the docs for more info on modules*

# Development Programs
Development programs are states of focus for projects like Simpl-Py. You can take a topic or feature that
needs improvement in a project and turn it into a dev program so developers have a focus and a goal.

Here is a list of  Dev Programs for Simpl-Py:
### Simpl-Py EXtended (2022) `CLOSED`
<img src="https://github.com/Zer0-Official/Simpl-Py/blob/main/src/media/SPY%20EX%20banner.png" align="right"/>
Simpl-Py EXtended (SPY-EX) is the first Dev Program for Simpl-Py. This program focuses on making the
language open to customization and adjustments for the user. This program may run for about 2 months.

Goals Accomplished:
* A new interpreter console for the language with enhancing and adjustment options
* A module system for users to add their own piece of code into the pie
* New advertising and communication guidelines for the user
* More interaction with the user within the language
* Fixes
